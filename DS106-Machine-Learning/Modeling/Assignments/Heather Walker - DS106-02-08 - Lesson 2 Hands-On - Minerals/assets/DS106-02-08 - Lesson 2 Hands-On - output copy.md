# DS106-02-08 - Lesson 2 Hands-On - Minerals

## Report Summary: 
> Current data indicates that we can predict the presence of Gold from the mineral Antimony being present; however, this predictive model is unreliable due to too small of a sample size. We would need more data to create a more trusted predictive model.

## 1.  The data does not meet the minimum sample size for binary logistic regression.

> This casts doubt on the subsequent findings below.
> 
> Found with: `Confusion Matrix` â€” there is one cell (Ref: 0, Pred: 1) that is below 5.

## 2.  The predictive model is 84% accurate.
> With a .8438 accuracy rate, this means that roughly 84% of the time, your predictions are correct.
> Found with:  `Confusion Matrix, Accuracy : 0.8438`



---


## 3.  There is a linear relationship between presence of Antimony and presence of Gold.
> There is a linear relationship between the predictors (x) and the outcome (y).

## 4.  We have independent errors.
> Residual Errors are independent from each other and predictors (x).
> There is an even distribution of points across your x axis, thus the data meets the assumption of independent errors.

> **Confirmed by plotting:**

> 



> **Also confirmed with Durbin-Watson test:**
> The p-value is not statistically significant (> .05)
> and DW score is over 1.

```OUTPUT
Durbin-Watson test

data:  mylogit
DW = 1.7616, p-value = 0.3316
alternative hypothesis: true autocorrelation is not 0
