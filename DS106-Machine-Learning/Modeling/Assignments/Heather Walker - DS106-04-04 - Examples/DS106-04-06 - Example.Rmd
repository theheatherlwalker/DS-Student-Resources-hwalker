# QUESTION:
# Create a model that will use `mpg` as the response variable, and the other 10 columns of data as potential predictor variables. It is assumed that all 10 predictors don't really belong in the model.
```

```{r}
# Create a linear model of all 10 predictor variables.
fitstart = lm(mpg ~ 1, data = mtcars)
```

```{r}
# Summary of model
summary(fitstart)
```

```{r}
step(fitstart, direction="both", scope=formula(FitAll))
