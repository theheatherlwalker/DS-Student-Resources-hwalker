# QUESTION:
# Create a model that will use `mpg` as the response variable, and the other 10 columns of data as potential predictor variables. It is assumed that all 10 predictors don't really belong in the model.
```

```{r}
# Create a linear model of all 10 predictor variables.
FitAll = lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
```

```{r}
# Summary of model
summary(FitAll)
```

```{r}
step(FitAll, direction = 'backward')
```

```{r}
# Create new model with just the un-eliminated variables:
fitsome = lm(mpg ~ am + qsec + wt, data = mtcars)

# Summary of model
summary(FitSome)
```
