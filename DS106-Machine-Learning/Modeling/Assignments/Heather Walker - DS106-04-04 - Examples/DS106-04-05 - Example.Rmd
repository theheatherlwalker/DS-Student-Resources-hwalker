# QUESTION:
# Create a model that will use `mpg` as the response variable, and the other 10 columns of data as potential predictor variables. It is assumed that all 10 predictors don't really belong in the model.
```

```{r}
# Create a linear model of all 10 predictor variables.
fitstart = lm(mpg ~ 1, data = mtcars)
```

```{r}
# Summary of model
summary(fitstart)
```

```{r}
# Create a complete forward selection
step(fitstart, direction = 'forward', scope = (~ cyl + disp + hp + drat + wt + qsec + vs + am + gear + carb))

# IF YOU'VE ALREADY WRITTEN A BACKWARDS ELIMINATION FUNCTION
# step(fitstart, direction = 'forward', scope = (formula(FitAll)))
```

```{r}
# Create a model with only the identified variables
fitsome2 = lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl + hp, data = mtcars)

summary(fitsome2)w
