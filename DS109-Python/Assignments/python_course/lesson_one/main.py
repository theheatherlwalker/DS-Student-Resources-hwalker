# DS109-01-17 - Variables Practice Hands-On

# 1. Create 3 variables to answer these questions:
# What is your name?
# How old are you?
# How many months is that? 
questionName = "What is your name?"
questionAgeYears = "How old are you?"
questionAgeMonths = "How many months is that?"



# 2. Create 3 more variables with these answers:
# My name is "Billy".
# 30
# 360
billyName = 'My name is "Billy".'
billyAgeYears = 30
billyAgeMonths = 360



# 3. Use the print function to output.
print(questionName)
print(billyName)
print(questionAgeYears)
print(billyAgeYears)
print(questionAgeMonths)
print(billyAgeMonths)



# 4. Comment out variables to print the output as
# What is your name?
# My name is "Billy".
# How old are you?
# 30
print(questionName)
print(billyName)
print(questionAgeYears)
print(billyAgeYears)
# print(questionAgeMonths)
# print(billyAgeMonths)



# 5. Create 3 new variables and 
# print them on separate lines.
# my_string
# my_integer
# my_float
my_string = 'My name is "Heather".'
my_integer = 36
my_float = 36.75

print(my_string)
print(my_integer)
print(my_float)
