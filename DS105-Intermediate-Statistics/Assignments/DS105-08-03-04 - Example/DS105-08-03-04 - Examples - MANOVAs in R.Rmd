# Load Libraries

The MANOVA function comes in the base package of R, so the libraries that you will need to load are all related to assumption testing. You will need the following: `mvnormtest` to test for multivariate normality, and `car` to test for homogeneity of variance.

```{r}
# install.packages("mvnormtest")
library("mvnormtest")
library("car")
library("dplyr")
```

# Load Data

```{r}
kickstarter <- read.csv("./data/kickstarter.csv")

  # View data
    head(kickstarter)
```

# Question Setup

You will be answering the following question with this data:

    Does the country the project originated in influence the number of backers and the amount of money pledged?

To answer this question, the independent variable will be the country the project originated in, `country`. This is a categorical variable. The two dependent variables will be the number of backers (`backers`) and the amount pledged (`pledged`). These variables are both continuous.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Data Wrangling

Although no data wrangling is actually required for the MANOVA itself, some wrangling is required to test for assumptions.

In order to test for multivariate normality, you will need to create a dataset containing only your two dependent variables that is in a matrix format, and you will need to ensure that they are numeric.

Unfortunately, the test for normality can only handle 5,000 records, so you will also need to limit your data to 5,000 rows as well.

### Ensure Dependent Variables are Numeric

And then check the structure of the data to see what format your dependent variables are in.

```{r}
str(kickstarter$pledged)
str(kickstarter$backers)
```

Oh no! Both of them are currently set up as factors! Best convert them using the `as.numeric()` function.

```{r}
kickstarter$pledged <- as.numeric(kickstarter$pledged)
kickstarter$backers <- as.numeric(kickstarter$backers)
```

### Subsetting

Next, keep only your two dependent variabes, `pledged` and `backers`.

```{r}
keeps <- c("pledged", "backers")
kickstarter1 <- kickstarter[keeps]
```

Then limit the number of rows:

```{r}
kickstarter2 <- kickstarter1[1:5000,]
```

### Format as a Matrix

Lastly, format the data as a matrix.

```{r}
kickstarter3 <- as.matrix(kickstarter2)
```

You are now ready to perform the assumptions test for multivariate normality on `kickstarter3`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Test Assumptions

With the data wrangling out of the way, it is now time to test assumptions!

### **Sample Size**

The first assumption of MANOVAs is sample size. The rule of thumb is that you must have at least 20 cases per independent variable, and that there must be more cases then dependent variables in every cell. Meaning that there must be more than 2 cases for each country. Happily, both of these are fulfilled with a dataset of 323,746!

```{r}
str(kickstarter)
```

```{r}
kickstarter %>% count(country, sort = TRUE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Multivariate Normality**

To test for multivariate normality, you will first need to drop any missing values using the code below:

```{r}
kickstarter4 <- na.omit(kickstarter3)
```

Now you can use the dataset you wrangled, `kickstarter4`, in the Wilks-Shapiro test. You can do that with the function `mshapiro.test()` pulled from the `mvnormtest` library:

```{r}
mshapiro.test(t(kickstarter4))
```

You have **violated the assumption of multivariate normality if the *p* value is significant at *p* \< .05**, so unfortunately, these data do not meet the assumption for MANOVAs. However, for learning purposes, you will continue.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Homogeneity of Variance

You can use Levene's Test from the `car` library to test for homogeneity of variance on both of your dependent variables:\

```{r}
leveneTest(kickstarter$pledged, kickstarter$country, data=kickstarter)
```

Don't forget to test for `backers` as well!

```{r}
leveneTest(kickstarter$backers, kickstarter$country, data=kickstarter)
```

Unfortunately, **neither variable met the assumption of homogeneity of variance, since they were both significant at *p* \< .05**. You have violated the assumption of homogeneity of variance, but you will proceed for now for learning purposes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Absence of Multicollinearity**

Typically, multicollinearity can be assessed simply by running correlations of your dependent variables with each other. A general rule of thumb is that anything above approximately .7 for correlation (i.e. a strong correlation) indicates the presence of multicollinearity. Check out the correlation between `pledged` and `backers` with a simple `cor.test()` function:

```{r}
cor.test(kickstarter$pledged, kickstarter$backers, method="pearson", use="complete.obs")
```

And voila! **Finally an assumption you have met! With a correlation of *r* = .32, you have an absence of multicollinearity.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Run Analysis

You will use the function `manova` to run a MANOVA. Go figure!

In this code, you are binding your two dependent variables together with the function `cbind()`, so they can be examined as one. Then you are able to specify your independent variable, `country`, like any other ANOVA. Here are the results when you call `summary`:

```{r}
MANOVA <- manova(cbind(pledged, backers) ~ country, data = kickstarter)
summary(MANOVA)
```

Tada! You have run your first MANOVA. **Looks like it was significant, too - there is a significant difference in backers and the funds they have pledged by country.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Post Hocs

But which dependent variable you ask? Well, that's where the post-hocs come in.

### ANOVAs as Post Hocs

The initial post-hoc for a MANOVA is, in fact, an ANOVA. Luckily, there is code set aside to do this as a post-hoc in R, so that you don't have to create your own ANOVA models. Check out the `summary.aov()` function in action.

Simply feed in the name of your MANOVA model. This function would work without the additional argument of `test=`, but like post-hocs for ANOVAs, it is nice to use a correction for Type I error since you are doing so many multiple comparisons. In this case, you can use the `"wilks` correction, specified above.

Here are the results:

```{r}
summary.aov(MANOVA, test = "wilks") 
```

Isn't R wonderful? It provides you with the appropriate output for both dependent variables with one click. **As you can see here, there is a significant difference in both the amount of funds pledged and the number of backers by country.**
