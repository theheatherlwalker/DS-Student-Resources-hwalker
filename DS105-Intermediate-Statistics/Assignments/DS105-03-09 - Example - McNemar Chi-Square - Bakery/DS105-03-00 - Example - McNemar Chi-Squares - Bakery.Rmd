# **McNemar Chi-Squares**

> The McNemar Chi-Square is used when you are trying to look at something over time, and have only two timepoints; maybe a pre and a post.
>
> The timepoints are your independent variable. You are also limited to two levels of your dependent variable. You can think of a McNemar Chi-Square like a dependent *t*-test for categorical data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Load Libraries

In order to complete McNemar Chi-Squares in R, the only libraries you will need are `gmodels` to conduct the Chi-Square, and `tidyr` to do some data wrangling (though you might not always need to wrangle your data).

```{r}
library("gmodels")
library("tidyr")
```

## Load Data

```{r}
bakery_sales <- read.csv("./assets/bakery_sales.csv")

  # VIEW THE DATA
  View(bakery_sales)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question Setup

You will be answering the following question:

`Do the sales of coffee change from the beginning of the month to the end of the month?`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Wrangling

Looking at your data, you will find that you only have a single `Date` variable, and that you only have a single `Item` variable. `Date` is not broken up yet into the beginning and the end of the month, and `Item` is not broken into coffee or other. So, you will need to do a bit of recoding!

#### Check the structure of your data

First, it's always a good idea to check the structure of your data. You can use the `str()` function to do so:

```{r}
str(bakery_sales)
```

The first thing that you should notice here is that your `Date` column is not formatted as a date, and you will need to do that before going farther.

#### Reformatting to a Date

Reformatting to a date can be done with the function `as.Date()`:

```{r}
bakery_sales$DateR <- as.Date(bakery_sales$Date, format="%m/%d/%Y")
```

You can specify that this be a new variable by putting a new name at the front before the `<-`, and then you'll use the function `as.Date()`. Specify the original variable you are formatting as a date, and then you'll need to use the argument `format=` to specify how the date has come in. Remember that the format needs to match the data exactly. The `%m` is for a decimal month, the `%d` is for a decimal day, and the `%Y` is for a four-digit year. You will notice that they are all separated by a `/` because that is how the data are separated in the orginal column.

#### Separating the pieces of the Date Variable

Once that is done, you will want to separate this out, so that you can look at and recode the `Day` column individually. You'll utilize the `separate()` function from the `tidyr` package:

```{r}
bakery_sales1 <- separate(bakery_sales, DateR, c("Year", "Month", "Day"), sep="-")
```

And the result is that you now have month, day, and year, all split out in your dataset.

#### Recoding the beginning or end of Month

Now that you have `Day` separated from the pack, you can see to the recoding:

```{r}
bakery_sales1$DayR <- NA
bakery_sales1$DayR[bakery_sales1$Day <= 15] <- 0
bakery_sales1$DayR[bakery_sales1$Day > 15] <- 1
```

This code first opens up a new variable named `DayR`, and then splits the content in half. Anything that is on the 15th of the month or earlier is recoded as a zero, while anything on the 16th of the month or later will be recoded as a one.

#### Recoding to `Coffee` or `Other`

The last recode you have left to undertake is to recode the `Item` variable from listing every single item out to recoding into the discrete categories of coffee or not coffee. Below, you'll find code that creates a new variable named `CoffeeSales` and fills it with a 1 for anything that is `Coffee` and fills it with a 0 for anything that is not coffee.

```{r}
bakery_sales1$CoffeeSales <- NA
bakery_sales1$CoffeeSales[bakery_sales1$Item == "Coffee"] <- 1
bakery_sales1$CoffeeSales[bakery_sales1$Item != "Coffee"] <- 0
```

And with that, you are now ready to launch into your assumption testing and analysis!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Test assumptions and run analysis

The assumptions for a McNemar Chi-Square is the same as for an independent Chi-Square: you need to have at least 5 expected observations in each cell. And just like the independent Chi-Square, in R, you will need to run the entire analysis first and then check the assumption. All the code is nearly the same, too, except that you will add in the argument of `mcnemar=TRUE`. Take a look:

```{r}
CrossTable(bakery_sales1$DayR, bakery_sales1$CoffeeSales, fisher=TRUE, chisq = TRUE, mcnemar = TRUE, expected = TRUE, sresid=TRUE, format="SPSS")
```

#### Check assumption of Expected Frequencies

In order to meet the assumption for the McNemar Chi-Square, you will need to have at least 5 expected per cell. With the lowest expected value being in the two thousands, you have definitely met this assumption!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Interpret Results

You will start by looking at the *p* value for `McNemar's Chi-squared test`. It doesn't usually matter whether you look at the original or the one with the continuity correction - they are usually pretty close. If the *p* value is less than .05, then this test is significant. This means that on this occasion, there is a difference in coffee sales from the beginning to the end of the month.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Post Hocs

What does that difference actually look like? Well that's a matter for post hocs, and again, like the independent Chi-Square, you will examine the standardized residuals. Anything with an absolute value of 2 (can be positive or negative) differs from expected. However, looking at your post hocs (which have been corrected to account for the possibility of Type I error), you find that none of your standardized residuals are over 2. This means that this test was not really significant after all. A good litmus test for this is to look at your row total percentages. See how sales at the beginning of the month are at 52%, and sales at the end of the month are 48%? Do the sales of coffee change from the beginning of the month to the end of the month? Although these are technically different, they're pretty darn close, and the test has decided that they are similar enough that it is not significant.
