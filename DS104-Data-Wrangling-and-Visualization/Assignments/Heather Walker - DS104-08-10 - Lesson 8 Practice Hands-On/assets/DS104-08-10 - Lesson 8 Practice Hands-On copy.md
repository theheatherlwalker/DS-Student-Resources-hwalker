### Directions

For your Hands-On, you will examine and assess complex visualizations. This Hands-On will **not** be graded, but you are encouraged to complete it. The best way to become a great data scientist is to practice! When you are done, please submit one document with all of your findings for grading.

### Requirements

For this skills mastery assessment, you will do something a bit different. Since software used to create complex visualizations is usually proprietary and not readily available, you won't be asked to create one from a given dataset.

Instead, you should find four different complex visualizations on the web. Your task is to critique the visualizations you find. You should list both pros and cons for each visualization, and also talk about what you might do differently if you were creating the visualization.
