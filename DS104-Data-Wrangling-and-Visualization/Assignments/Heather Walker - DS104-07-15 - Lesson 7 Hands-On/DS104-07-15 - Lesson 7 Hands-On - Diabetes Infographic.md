## Directions

For your Hands-On, you will create an infographic from World Health Organization Fact Sheet data. This Hands-On will **not** be graded, but you are encouraged to complete it. The best way to become a great data scientist is to practice! When you are done, please submit one document with all of your findings for grading.

- Be sure to zip and submit your entire directory when finished!
- Do not submit your project until you have completed all requirements, as you will not be able to resubmit.

## Requirements

Using the data from **[this World Health Organization fact sheet on diabetes](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diabetes)** create an infographic. You do not need to utilize all the information provided; just ensure that you follow the steps of infographic creation to determine your own purpose, audience, and message before starting! Make sure to focus on the data elements as much as possible, and your infographic should be **just one page.**

You can use any program you like - MS Power Point or equivalents such as Keynote or Open Office; any of the online infographic designs if you're feeling froggy (ready to take a leap!), or any other graphic design software with which you may be familiar. Ensure that you utilize an appropriate layout and design elements.

You will be graded using **[this checklist](https://magnoliaconsulting.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Checklist-for-Reviewing-Infographics.pdf)** for reviewing infographics, so ensure you run your creation through this review before you turn it in. Above all, your infographic should be easy to read at a glance, convey a message, and be compelling.
