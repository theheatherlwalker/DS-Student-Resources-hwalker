### Directions

For your Hands-On, you will choose the most appropriate analysis for the scenarios below, in which a store determines the best way to utilize a new club card system. When you are done, please submit one document with all of your findings for grading.

---

### For all scenarios, please identify the following:

**1. The independent variable(s) and its data type**
- The independent variable, also known as the predictor variable, it is the variable or variables that influence your dependent variable. They are causing some sort of effect.

**2. The levels of the independent variable, if appropriate**

**3. The dependent variable(s) and its data type**
- The dependent variable, also known as the outcome variable, is what you are influencing. It's what you're predicting. It is the effect that is being caused by your independent variable. The dependent variable depends on the independent variable.

**4. The levels of the dependent variable, if appropriate**

**5. The most appropriate analysis**
- The most appropriate analysis can be found by following the flow charts on either of pages 5, 6 & 7 once you identified the IV(s), DV(s), their data types and levels.

|               SCENARIO NUMBER  |     |
| ------------------------- | --- |
| Independent Variable(s)   |     |
| IV data type              |     |
| IV levels (if applies)    |     |
| Dependent Variable(s)     |     |
| DV data type              |     |
| DV levels (if applies)    |     |
| Most Appropriate Analysis |     |

## Scenario 1

A store is investigating the influence of gender upon whether customers sign up for a discount club card. Options for gender are male and female, and options for signing up for the club card are signed up and not signed up.

|               SCENARIO 1  |     |
| ------------------------- | --- |
| Independent Variable(s)   |  Gender   |
| IV data type              |  Categorical (binary)   |
| IV levels (if applies)    |  2   |
| Dependent Variable(s)     |  Signing up for card   |
| DV data type              |  Categorical (binary)  |
| DV levels (if applies)    |  2   |
| Most Appropriate Analysis |  Make associations, <br />have 2 variables that are categorical: <br />**Spearman Rank Correlation**  |

## Scenario 2

This same store has just expanded their club card system. They now have three different tiers - silver, gold, and platinum. They would like to know whether the type of club card the customer has dictates how much money the customer spends.

|               SCENARIO 2  |     |
| ------------------------- | --- |
| Independent Variable(s)   |  Amount customer spends   |
| IV data type              |  Continuous   |
| IV levels (if applies)    |  n/a   |
| Dependent Variable(s)     |  Card Tier   |
| DV data type              |  Categorical   |
| DV levels (if applies)    |  3   |
| Most Appropriate Analysis |  Continuous IV, more than 2 levels in DV: <br />**Stepwise Multinomial Logistic Regression**  |

## Scenario 3

Now, the store manager would like to know: Do people spend more money before or after they get a club card?

|               SCENARIO 3  |     |
| ------------------------- | --- |
| Independent Variable(s)   |  Getting a club card   |
| IV data type              |  Categorical (binary)   |
| IV levels (if applies)    |  2   |
| Dependent Variable(s)     |  Amount customer spends   |
| DV data type              |  Continuous   |
| DV levels (if applies)    |  n/a   |
| Most Appropriate Analysis |  Drawing conclusion for Categorical IV, <br />only 1 Continuous DV, changes over time:<br />**Dependent _t_-test**  |

## Scenario 4

Lastly, the store manager would like to know if the age of a customer predicts whether that customer will sign up for a club card or not.

|               SCENARIO 4  |     |
| ------------------------- | --- |
| Independent Variable(s)   |  Customer age   |
| IV data type              |  Continuous   |
| IV levels (if applies)    |  n/a   |
| Dependent Variable(s)     |  Card sign up   |
| DV data type              |  Categorical (binary)   |
| DV levels (if applies)    |  2   |
| Most Appropriate Analysis |  Drawing conclusion for Continuous IV <br />with Categorical DV with 2 levels, <br />find influence of each variable: <br />**Stepwise Binary Logistic Regression**  |
