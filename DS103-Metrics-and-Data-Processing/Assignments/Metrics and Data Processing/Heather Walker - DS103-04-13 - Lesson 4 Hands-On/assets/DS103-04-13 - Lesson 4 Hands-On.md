# Lesson 4 Hands-On

## Directions

Pick a topic that you are interested in, and create a survey about that topic. 

Ensure that you look for questions on the topic before making them up, and if you do need to make up your own questions, remember to choose the right question types and follow the rules of designing your own survey questions! 

Although you do not have to test your survey, create a plan for testing it and write it down.

You will then add this survey on Survey Monkey, and attach the text document of your survey as well as the web link it can be found at on Survey Monkey in your final submission.

# TOPIC:  AI-generated art

# Further survey refinement

### Limited to free features in SurveyMonkey
There were several premium features that I would wish to use for a more in-depth survey, such as:
- comment box (longer text response)
- branching logic (skip logic)


___
### Targeted questions (with skip logic) 
I would like to focus in on artists and their opinions of ai-generated art in relation to copyright and how they might use it in their work. 


___
### Testing the survey
I would test the survey by first having a few trusted (and frank) participants, both artists and non-artists.
As I refine it, I would post in ai-generated art forums and communities â€” while this does inherently skew towards a population that would view the topic favorably, I think that my true aim with a more in depth survey would be more for this audience, to dig into how they are using it.
