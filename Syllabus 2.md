Students will be able to determine which hypothesis test to utilize and be able to perform that test. Students will also learn to identify and verify the data requirements for each hypothesis test.

DSO106 Machine Learning and Modeling
Hours: Theory 30 / Laboratory 30 / Total 60 / Quarter Credits 4.5 / Outside Hours 15 / Prerequisites: DSO102, DSO108, & DSO109
The Machine Learning and Modeling course will introduce students to several commonly used machine learning methods. Students will learn how to determine the best methods for a given set of data, and how to use common software tools to utilize these methods.

DSO107 Introduction to Big Data
Hours: Theory 30 / Laboratory 30 / Total 60 / Quarter Credits 4.5 / Outside Hours 15 / Prerequisites: DSO102, DSO104, & DSO109
The Introduction to Big Data course introduces students to Big Data on a conceptual level, and gives students exposure and practice with several skills and tools currently in use. These skills will be taught at a manageable level, and then scale up methods will be used to help students grasp the meaning and popularity of analyzing substantial amounts of data. Students will learn the foundational concepts of Big Data and will know how to move from Big Data basics to more business specific needs and requirements.

DSO108 Databases
Hours: Theory 30 / Laboratory 30 / Total 60 / Quarter Credits 4.5 / Outside Hours 15 / Prerequisites: None
This course is an introduction to working with, and designing databases. Students will develop a foundational knowledge of database concepts, theory, and an overview of the various implementations and architectures.

DSO109 Programming Foundations
Hours: Theory 30 / Laboratory 30 / Total 60 / Quarter Credits 4.5 / Outside Hours 15 / Prerequisites: None
This course will give students programming foundations in languages utilized in the industry. This course also provides a secure foundation upon which students can build on as they progress through the program.

DSO110 Group Project
Hours: Theory 50 / Laboratory 110 / Total 160 / Quarter Credits 10.5 / Outside Hours 15/Prerequisites: Final Mod
The Group Project course combines each part of the program into a group project for the student. Each student will work together as a team member for the group project, which includes daily scrum meetings to cover tasks and progress while working separately to complete them. The final group project is due at the end of the course.
